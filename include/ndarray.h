/**
 * @mainpage ndarray; Multidimensional Arrays in C++
 *
 * %ndarray is a template library that provides multidimensional array objects in C++, with
 * an interface and features designed to mimic the Python 'numpy' package as much as possible.
 *
 * A tutorial can be found \ref ndarrayTutorial "here".
 *
 * @section comparisons Other Multidimensional Array Libraries
 *
 * A number of other public C++ multidimensional array libraries already exist, such as
 * boost.MultiArray, Blitz++, and xtensor.  Much of the architecture and some of the interface of the
 * %ndarray templates is built on ideas from both of these, particularly boost.MultiArray.
 * %ndarray supports shared ownership of data, lazy evaluation of mathematical
 * operations using expression templates, and the ability to use externally
 * allocated memory.  It also supports optimized, natural, nested iteration and
 * preserve const-correctness (albeit with different semantics).
 *
 * While %ndarray can perform numerical operations with broadcasting, it makes
 * no attempt to perform explicit vectorization, and libraries that focus more
 * on computational performance will be better at it in almost every context.
 * %ndarray's goal is to provide lightweight, flexible data structures with a
 * more Python-friendly ownership model, while maintaining enough static typing
 * to allow optimized libraries (such as Eigen) to work effectively on
 * ndarray-managed arrays.
 *
 * @section semantics Copy and Constness Semantics
 *
 * The memory used by %ndarray objects is reference counted, and can be allocated
 * using any STL-compatible allocator.  Arrays can also be constructed from external
 * memory buffers, with full reference counting for any external memory owned by
 * an object that participates in any reference-counting scheme (most notably
 * memory belonging to Python Numpy arrays in C++ Python extensions).  Reference counting
 * can also be disabled for individual arrays that reference external memory that
 * is not reference-counted.
 *
 * Array objects in %ndarray preserve constness in the same way as most C++
 * smart pointers: there is a distinction between an array with const elements
 * (Array<T const,N>) and a const array value or reference (Array<T,N> const).
 * An array with const elements does not support operations that change element
 * values ("deep" operations), while a const array object or reference does not
 * allow the array's data pointer, shape, or strides to be changed ("shallow"
 * operations).  As a result, functions should generally use const references
 * for both input and output array arguments (with const and non-const
 * elements, respectively).  Arrays with non-const elements are implicitly (and
 * efficiently) convertible to arrays with const elements, while an array with
 * const elements can be cast to one with non-const elements using the
 * const_array_cast function.
 *
 * @section contiguousness The Row-Major Contiguous Template Parameter
 *
 * In addition to being templated on its element type and total number of
 * dimensions, Array is parameterized by the number of guaranteed row-major
 * contiguous (RMC) dimensions, starting from the end.  This parameter defaults
 * to zero.  For example:
 *
 * - Array<T,2,2> is a fully row-major contiguous matrix.  Each row of the
 *   matrix is a vector with contiguous elements, and there is no space between
 *   rows.
 *
 * - Array<T,2,1> is a row-major matrix in which each row is a vector with
 *   contiguous elements, but there may be space between the rows (or there may
 *   not be; the template parameter indicates only the guaranteed number of RMC
 *   dimensions).
 *
 * - Array<T,2,0> is a matrix that can have any strides, including
 *   column-major.
 *
 * An Array with M RMC dimensions can be implicitly converted to an Array with
 * N<=M RMC dimensions.  The `static_dimension_cast` and
 * `dynamic_dimension_cast` functions can be used to create arrays with M<N RMC
 * dimensions (dynamic_dimension_cast returns an empty Array if the strides are
 * not appropriately RMC, while static_dimension_cast does no checking).
 *
 * @section ndarrayViews Indexing and Views
 *
 * An Array with dimension N>1 behaves like largely like an STL container of
 * Array of dimension N-1.  An Array with dimension 1 behaves like a simple
 * container of elements.  Iterators over an Array with N>1 thus dereference to
 * Arrays with dimension N-1, and standard [] indexing also yields the expected
 * lower-dimensional array.
 *
 * Arbitrary views can be retrieved by passing a view definition to an Array's
 * bracket indexing operators.  These view definitions are temporaries created
 * by the view() function:
 * @code
 * // let 'a' be a 3 dimensional array with dimensions (3,5,4)
 *
 * // equivalent to a[1:3,:,2] in numpy:
 * Array<double,2,1> subset1 = a[view(1,3)()(2)];
 *
 * // equivalent to a[:,:,0:4:2] in numpy in numpy:
 * Array<double,3> subset2 = a[view()()(0,4,2)];
 * @endcode
 * Supplying a single integer indexes a dimension by a scalar (which reduces
 * the dimension of output), supplying a pair of integers indicates a
 * contiguous range, and supplying three integers indicates a slice.
 * Specifying no arguments for a dimension includes the entire dimension.  Not
 * indexing all dimensions is equivalent to including empty parentheses for the
 * remaining dimensions.

/**
 * @page ndarrayTutorial Tutorial
 *
 * @section installation Installation
 *
 * %ndarray is a header-only library; after downloading and unpacking the
 * source, you can start using it immediately simply by adding it to your
 * compiler's include path.
 *
 * For tests, we use the Cmake build system, but CMake is not necessary to make
 * use of the library.
 *
 * @section construction Creating New Arrays
 *
 * Array objects have two normal constructors intended for public use, the
 * default constructor and a converting copy constructor.  The default
 * constructor creates an "empty" array, with a null data pointer and zero
 * shape.  The copy constructor creates a shared view into an existing array.
 *
 * @subsection new_arrays New Memory
 *
 * To create a new non-trivial array, one can use the allocate function, which
 * returns a temporary object implicitly convertible to Array:
 * @code
 * Array<double,3,3> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4,5));
 * // equivalent to
 * // >>> a = numpy.empty((3,4,5),dtype=float)
 * // in Python
 * @endcode
 * The makeVector function here is a variable-argument-length constructor for
 * the Vector object, a fixed-size array class whose int variant is used to
 * specify shape and strides for Array.  The appropriate Vector template for a
 * particular Array template is available as the Index typedef within the Array
 * class.
 *
 * The allocate function can also take an STL allocator as a template argument
 * and/or regular argument:
 * @code
 * Array<double,3,3> a = allocate< std::allocator<void> >(makeVector(3,4,5));
 * @endcode
 * @code
 * Array<double,3,3> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4,5), std::allocator<void>());
 * @endcode
 * Note that the type of the allocator does not have to match the type of the
 * array; the allocator's "rebind" member will be used to create the correct
 * allocator when the array is constructed.  Furthermore, unlike standard
 * library containers, Array is not templated on its allocator type; after
 * construction, it is impossible to determine how an Array's memory was
 * allocated.  An Array constructed by allocate is not generally initialized to
 * any value (do not assume it contains zeros).
 * @subsection external_memory External Memory
 * Arrays can also be constructed that point to external data:
 * @code
 * #include <cstdlib>
 * Array<double,1,1>::Owner owner(std::malloc(sizeof(double)*5), std::free);
 * Array<double,1,1>::Index shape = makeVector(5);
 * Array<double,1,1>::Index strides = makeVector(1);
 * Array<double,1,1> a = external(owner.get(), shape, strides, owner);
 * @endcode
 * The 'strides' vector here specifies the space between elements in each
 * dimension; the dot product of the strides vector with an index vector should
 * give the offset of the element with that index from the first element of the
 * array.
 * The 'Owner' type here is a typedef to a boost::shared_ptr, which can take an
 * arbitrary functor as a custom deleter (here, std::free).  By defining an
 * appropriate deleter, an array can manage virtually any kind of memory.
 * However, it is also possible to create an array with no reference counting
 * by passing an empty owner (or passing none at all):
 * @code
 * #include <cstdlib>
 * double data[] = { 5.3, 1.2, 6.3, 2.8, 7.0 };
 * Array<double,1,1>::Index shape = makeVector(5);
 * Array<double,1,1>::Index strides = makeVector(1);
 * Array<double,1,1> a = external(data, shape, strides);
 * @endcode
 * In this case, the user is responsible for ensuring that the data pointer
 * provided to the array remains valid during the array's lifetime, and is
 * eventually deallocated later.
 *
 * @section assignment Assignment
 *
 * Direct Array assignment is shallow:
 * @code
 * Array<double,1,1> a = allocate(makeVector(5));
 * Array<double,1,1> b;
 * b = a; // the two arrays now share data.
 * @endcode
 * To actually set the elements of an array, we can use Array::deep():
 * @code
 * Array<double,11,> b = allocate(a.getShape());
 * b.deep() = a; // 'b' is now a deep copy of 'a'.
 * @endcode
 * Scalar assignment and augmented assignment operations are also supported:
 * @code
 * b.deep() = 5.2;
 * b.deep() += a;
 * @endcode
 * The deep() method returns a proxy ArrayRef object, which behaves just like
 * an Array aside from its assignment operators, and is implicitly convertible
 * to Array.
 *
 * @section indexing_and_iteration Indexing and Iteration
 *
 * A multidimensional Array behaves like a container of Arrays with lower
 * dimensions, while a one-dimensional Array behaves like a container of
 * elements:
 * @code
 * int data = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 };
 * Array<int,2,2> a = external(data, makeVector(4,3));
 * // make 'b' a view into the second row of 'a' (Reference is a typedef to Array<int,1,1>):
 * Array<int,2,2>::Reference br = a[1]; // br is an ArrayRef<int,1,1>.
 * Array<int,2,2>::Value b = a[1];      // b is an Array<int,1,1>
 * Array<int,2,2>::Element b0 = b[0];   // b0 == 6; Element is a typedef to int.
 * Array<int,2,2>::Reference::Value b1 = b[1];     // b1 == 7; Reference::Value is also int.
 * Array<int,2,2>::Reference::Reference b2 = b[2]; // b2 == 8; Reference::Reference is int&.
 * @endcode
 * Indexing operations return ArrayRef objects, not Arrays.  This allows them to be
 * assigned to without manually calling deep():
 * @code
 * a[1] -= 3; // subtract three from the entire second row.
 * @endcode
 *
 * For one dimensional arrays, the "Reference" typedef is equivalent to
 * "Element &", while the "Value" typedef is equivalent to "Element".  For
 * multidimensional arrays, "Reference" is a lower-dimensional ArrayRef, while
 * "Value" is a lower-dimensional Array.
 *
 * Array is designed to have lightweight nested iterators, with types provided
 * by the Array::Iterator typedef.  For contiguous one-dimensional arrays
 * (Array<T,1,1>), this is a typedef to a simple pointer.  The typical pattern
 * to iterate over a 3-dimensional array looks like the following:
 * @code
 * Array<double,3,3> a = allocate(makeVector(5,6,8));
 * for (Array<double,3,3>::Iterator i = a.begin(); i != a.end(); ++i) {
 *     for (Array<double,3,3>::Reference::Iterator j = i->begin(); j != i->end(); ++j) {
 *         for (Array<double,3,3>::Reference::Reference::Iterator k = j->begin(); k != j->end(); ++k) {
 *              // *k == a[i - a.begin()][j - i->begin()][k - j->begin()];
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 * As expected, the iterators of multidimensional arrays dereference to
 * lower-dimensional arrays, and the iterators of one-dimensional arrays
 * dereference to elements.  With some compilers, it may be advantageous to
 * move the calls to end() outside their loops.
 *
 * Just like direct indexing, multidimensional array iterators dereference to
 * ArrayRef, not Array.
 *
 * STL-compliant typedefs "iterator", "const_iterator", "reference",
 * "const_reference", and "value" are also provided, though the const variants
 * are not actually const (because Array provides smart-pointer
 * const-correctness rather than container const-correctness).
 *
 * Single elements can be extracted from multidimensional arrays by indexing
 * with ndarray::Vector:
 * @code
 * a[makeVector(3,2,1)] == a[3][2][1];
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section ndarrayTutorialViews Views
 *
 * General views into an Array are created by passing a ViewDef object to the
 * [] operators of Array, returning a new Array that shares data and owns a
 * reference to the original.
 *
 * ViewDef involves a lot of template metaprogramming, so the actual template
 * class is an internal %detail, and ViewDefs are constructed by calls to the
 * view() function function followed by chained calls to the function call
 * operator, resulting in a syntax that looks like this:
 * @code
 * Array<double,5> a = allocate(makeVector(3,5,2,6,4));
 * b = a[view(1)(0,3)()(4)];
 * @endcode
 * which is equivalent to the Python code:
 * @code
 * a = numpy.empty((3,5,2,6,4),dtype=float)
 * b = a[1,0:3,:,4]
 * @endcode
 * The value passed to each call specifies how to extract values from that
 * dimension:
 *
 * - A single integer selects a single subarray from that dimension, reducing
 *   the overall dimensionality of the view relative to the parent array by
 *   one.
 * - An empty call selects the entire dimension.
 * - A pair of integers selects a contiguous subset of subarrays from that
 *   dimension.
 * - A triplet of integers selects a noncontiguous subset of subarrays from
 *   that dimension.
 *
 * Any dimensions which are not specified because the length of the ViewDef expression is smaller
 * than the dimensionality of the parent array will be considered full-dimension selections:
 * @code
 * a[view(3)] == a[view(3)()()()()];
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section operators Arithmetic Operators and Comparison
 *
 * Arrays provide element-wise arithmetic operations that make use of
 * expression templates:
 * @code
 * Array<double,2,2> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * // initialize the elements of 'a'
 * Array<double,2,2> b = allocate(a.getShape());
 * b = a * 3 + 2; // this expression is lazy, and never allocates a temporary array
 * @endcode
 * We can simplify the previous example by initializing 'b' with the copy()
 * function, which is simply a shortcut for allocate and assign:
 * @code
 * Array<double,2,2> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * // initialize the elements of 'a'
 * Array<double,2,2> b = copy(a * 3 + 2);
 * @endcode
 * As a rule, %ndarray never allocates memory for a new array unless you
 * explicitly tell it to with the allocate() or copy() functions.
 *
 * Element-wise comparisons are also supported, but not via overloaded
 * operators:
 * @code
 * Array<double,2,2> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * // initialize the elements of 'a'
 * Array<double,2,2> b = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * // initialize the elements of 'b'
 * Array<bool,2,2> c = copy(equal(a, b));
 * @endcode
 * The element-wise comparison functions (equal, not_equal, less, less_equal,
 * greater, greater_equal) and logical operators (logical_and, logical_or,
 * logical_not) are also lazy, and are most useful when used in conjunction
 * with the reduction functions all() and any():
 * @code
 * Array<double,2,2> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * // initialize the elements of 'a'
 * Array<double,2,2> b = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * // initialize the elements of 'b'
 * bool v1 = all(logical_or(greater(a, b), greater(a, 3.0)));
 * bool v2 = any(less(b, a));
 * @endcode
 *
 * Array does overload the equality and inequality operators, but these compare
 * for "shallow" equality, not element-wise equality:
 * @code
 * Array<double,2,2> a = allocate(makeVector(3,4));
 * Array<double,2,2> b = copy(a);
 * bool v1 = (a == b); // false, because 'a' and 'b' do not share data.
 * Array<double const,2,1> c(a);
 * bool v2 = (a == c); // true, because 'a' and 'c' have the same data, shape, and strides.
 * @endcode
