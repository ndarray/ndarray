ndarray is a template library that provides multidimensional array
objects in C++, with an interface and features designed to mimic the
Python 'numpy' package as much as possible.

More information can be found in the Doxygen-generated documentation
(which is unhelpfully not built automatically at present...read
ndarray.h instead).


BUILDING FROM GIT

ndarray includes the Boost.NumPy library using git's "submodules"
feature.  When you clone the ndarray repository with git, you'll get
an empty Boost.NumPy directory.  Even if you don't plan to use
Boost.NumPy (which is required only if you want to build the
Boost.Python bindings for ndarray), it *is* necessary to checkout the
Boost.NumPy source (as parts of the build system is shared).  So,
immediately after cloning ndarray, you'll need to run:

git submodule update --init --recursive

From there, you'll be able to build ndarray and (optionally)
Boost.NumPy together just by running "scons" from the root of the
ndarray clone.


BUILDING FROM COMPRESSED SOURCE

GitHub's automatically generated tarballs and zip files don't include
the Boost.NumPy submodule or the git metadata needed to run "git
submodule", so these features can't be used to download ndarray.

When we post release downloads, however, we'll include the Boost.NumPy
source so they can be built directly.
